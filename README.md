Demo module used at DNN Connect 2015 in presentation by Peter Donker on WebAPI and Razor. 
It demonstrates an almost web-forms-less module development pattern based on the RazorHost module and
WebAPI. The presentation can be found here:

During the presentation you'll also the implementation of a custom authorization attribute in the DNN
WebAPI implementation used by this module. And you'll see how to serve out HTML generated by Razor over 
the WebAPI. The latter is an alternative to client-side templating.
